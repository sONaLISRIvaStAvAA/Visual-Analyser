Ultrasonic Radar with GUI Visualization

📌 Overview
This project is an ultrasonic radar system with a graphical user interface (GUI) visualization. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect objects within a specific range and displays real-time data on a radar-style interface using Processing IDE (Java).

🛠️ Features

✔️ Real-time object detection using an ultrasonic sensor
✔️ Radar-style sweeping visualization
✔️ Dynamic GUI representation of detected obstacles
✔️ Smooth animation using Processing (Java)

🖥️ Technologies Used

Hardware: Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04), Servo Motor, Arduino
Software:
Arduino IDE (for sensor control)
Processing IDE (for GUI visualization in Java)

🔧 Setup Instructions

1️⃣ Hardware Setup
Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino.
Attach the servo motor to rotate the sensor.
Wire the components properly according to the circuit diagram.

2️⃣ Software Installation
Install Arduino IDE and upload the Arduino code to your board.
Install Processing IDE for GUI visualization (Download Here).
Run the Processing sketch to start the radar visualization.


📊 How It Works

The servo motor rotates the ultrasonic sensor, scanning the environment.
The sensor detects objects and sends distance data to the Arduino.
The Arduino transmits the data to the Processing IDE via serial communication.
Processing plots the detected objects on a radar-like display in real time.


🎯 Future Enhancements

🔹 Add distance-based color coding for better visualization

🔹 Implement data logging for object tracking

🔹 Improve UI with additional graphical effects
